### About me:

My goal is to gain skills for employment in the company. Expand and improve my knowledge and experience. I'm not gonna stop there. I want to find my own path and follow it.

I have always been fascinated by creative tasks and processes, the search for interesting and creative solutions. Teamwork inspires no less. Because, this is a comprehensive development of both the members of this team and the entire project. My communication skills here will be most welcome.

I am a responsible person — I bring the matter to the end and to the deadline. I'm warning you if I can't get the job done on time. But I strive to prevent this from happening.

All my experience in this field is educational projects. I have an irresistible desire to learn and learn new things.
